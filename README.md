# miniRT
This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing. 

Once completed you will be able to render simple Computer-Generated-Images and you will never be afraid of implementing mathematical formulas again.


# 3D Rendering

When it comes to rendering 3-dimensional computer-generated images there are 2 possible approaches: 

- ***Rasterization*** - which is used by almost all graphic engines becauseof its efficiency.
- ***Ray Tracing***
